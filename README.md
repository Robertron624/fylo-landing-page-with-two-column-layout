## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this project I kept improving my layout and semantic HTML5 skills. I also learned how to use the CSS Grid and Flexbox to create a responsive layout.

### Continued development

I want to start working with more complex layouts and learn how to use the CSS Grid and Flexbox to create a responsive layout with minimal media queries.
